  - 

- save time

  - what do humans pay for
    - fun
    - stimulation (entertainment)
      - movies
      - music
    - health
    - land
    - food
      - alcohol
    - time (convenience)
      - cars
      - autopilot
      - bottled water
      - employees (wages)
    - status
      - cars
      - gym
      - luxury goods
      - why do humans want status?
