TL;DR cmux is a web app that spawns Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel across multiple tasks. For each run, cmux spawns an isolated openvscode instance via Docker or a configurable sandbox provider (like Morph/Daytona/E2B). The openvscode instance by default opens the git diff UI and a terminal with the running dev server (configurable via devcontainer.json).

Recently, I've almost completely moved from Cursor to Claude Code. I spend more time in the vscode terminal + vscode git than I do in Cursor's sidebar.

Each one of the "node" terminals is an instance of Claude Code (--dangerously-skip-permissions!). Usually, I can only juggle two or three Claudes at a time in different parts of the codebase. Most of the "node" processes at the top are Claude sessions from the past, as I find it easier to make new terminals instead of clearing Claude's context.

I've recently started using git worktrees to make more isolated environments for Claude Code.

Instead of juggling claudes in a single directory, I really should be using git worktrees.

cmux uses git worktrees to make isolated environments for Claude Code. It also uses 

## Sandboxing

On macOS, Codex uses sandbox-exec as a minimal sandbox. Claude Code doesn't have any real sandboxing. 

## Searching for the best CLI coding agent

Today, the best general coding agent is Claude Code. But codex + o3 is anecdotally better for me when I want to implement/optimize a well defined piece of code that doesn't require significant retrieval. Not having to think about which implementation is better for what is one of the goals of cmux, though this comes at the (sometimes steep) cost of tokens.

## Verification is a hard problem

## Tools for reviewing work

The first iteration of cmux included runs + diffs:

![cmux first iteration runs + diffs screenshot](/cmux/cmux-v0-runs-diffs.png)

I still found myself going back to the vscode terminal though, since there was no easy way to verify if the code worked or not. Having a vscode instance where I could easily look at the logs was important.

## Other Claude Code wrappers

There's a lot of people thinking about this space:

- https://www.terragonlabs.com/
- https://github.com/getAsterisk/claudia
- https://github.com/kbwo/ccmanager
- https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad

I still decided to work on cmux to scratch my own itch. I also had some specific needs that other wrappers didn't entirely satisfy, so it made sense to build my own. Some needs (that I may or may not have implemented yet):

- Open source
- Running dev servers, which is very important for manually testing/verifying if frontend code works.
- Better interface for reviewing outputs. For example, if it's a UI, I want 
- One liner (`bunx cmux ssh`) that sshs into a remote machine and starts a cmux instance accessible from the browser, to make it easier to use cmux on remote machines.
- Polished mobile app, not a PWA wrapper.

## How is this different from Devin or chatgpt.com/codex?

Claude Code is arguably a better coding agent than Devin.

## Standards

There exists AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .cursorrules, etc. If you have a CLAUDE.md file, cmux will automatically create the right files for each coding agent.

AGENTS.md

## Why can't I just ________

- Use worktrees: no actual isolation
- Use @claude on GitHub issues: 1. you have to use GitHub, 2. 

## After Cursor

operator automatically navigates to the right page and takes a screenshot and sends to you in chat.

after cursor is pretty much devin.
after devin is linear, like kanban where you see all the tickets and what needs reviewing.
after linear is tiktok + tinder. like infinite feed of agents with completed tasks that need your review. ideally with evidence that makes things easily verifiable. like computer use trajectories. or veo3/ai generated videos that somehow convey the right information?

what's after tiktok/tinder?
is the developer even relevant then?

## On launching early

An early version of cmux was ready a while ago. I didn't launch it because I didn't find it useful. It's hard to verify if code works from just diffs, and the workflow for 

# Git worktrees vs copy vs git pull

On Conductor's Show HN, myflash13 commented:

> I was really excited to try this but this does NOT work the way I expected. I wanted a simple git worktree manager for my existing, already-checked-out repository. Instead, it requests Github permissions and clones the repo from Github. This is bad, because you need to run all the dependency installs, etc. for every workspace before being able to test anything. In other words it's like Codex or Cursor Background Agents, except worse, because it's on your machine. The reason I don't use Codex or Background Agents is because my project has way too many dependencies and would take way too long (and too complicated) to install everything required to have an isolated running instance, plus there would be DNS conflicts, external API conflicts, among other issues.

> What I do want is simple git worktree management for an already-checked-out repo on my machine, no Github permissions or dependency re-installation (copying node_modules, etc.).

This is a very valid point, and I'm still thinking about how to satisfy myflash13's use case while still making verification easy. For example, setting up Bun's development environment takes 10-30 minutes. I think one reason Jarred Sumner finds Cluade Code so much more useful than more async coding agents like Devin, is that he can immediately run
