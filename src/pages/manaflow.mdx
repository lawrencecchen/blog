While we were in S24, my cofounders and I were invited to Paul Graham's house for office hours (either we were randomly picked or someone thought Paul should give us an idea to pivot to). Paul explained that Manaflow is a table where each row represents a case of a task and each column represents a step of a task.

This is probably as general as an idea can get. And general ideas are really hard to sell.

Investors want you to build Salesforce, but I wanted to build Excel.

Characteristically, Paul was optimistic. He told us to tell investors "the reason this is hard to explain is because it's so general, but because it's so general it means it'll be huge!"
