my thoughts:
tldr; no-code kinda sucks. vercel/netlify/infrastructure is pretty good. remix should compete for the former. they’ll also have higher margins (eg. zapier, wordpress, wix, etc.)

- devtool companies primarily add value on aws by increasing output/developer:
    - enable devs to ship faster and scale with less ppl (heroku, vercel/netlify, supabase/planetscale, flightcontrol/railway)

- (ofc you can hire ppl and build everything from raw compute/storage/networking, but the point of devtools is to increase each person’s leverage)
    - first principles: to create value, you need either a) more output/person and/or b) more people
    - devtools does the former. no-code does the latter.

- you can create more value by replacing traditional devs. software is probably 1st/2nd most expensive thing to hire for
    - eg. retool worth more than vercel. gl comparing to wix/wordpress
    - supply/demand: there are less developers than “pseudo-no-code-devs-who-can-deliver-business-value”

- eventually gpus will be cheaper than people. but for now, making devs marginally more productive (devtools) is less valuable than increasing the number of “devs” (no-code)
    - side note: no-code enables devs to focus on more valuable problems

- no-code tools kinda suck rn, and a performance-minded team with deep expertise in web fundamentals could deliver so much value this way. 
    - leverage that by making mass-consumed no-code tools better, not by giving devs something only slightly better
    - also a very obvious path to squarespace/wordpress/wix/webflow level valuations
- enable non-devs to make fast/powerful websites (expanding the pie) vs making dev’s life easier than the competition (stealing the pie)
    - the former will make more $$$

- what MJ theorized remix could sell:
    - analytics/logging
    - asset hosting
    - databases
- ^ low margin stuff (vercel/netlify is also very low margin lol, yet they somehow justify being expensive. pricing war w/ vercel/netlify will probably be net positive for humanity, but PLEASE just make no-code tools)

“that’s a huge problem” 16:12
- consistency of web apps (stale data)
- mutations as first class api
    - remix.run won
- what MJ theorized they could sell:
    - analytics/logging

- remix has deep technical expertise.
    - leverage that by making mass-consumed no-code tools better, not giving devs something only slightly better
    - remix can make creating fast + powerful websites accessible for a many no-code devs/non-technical people
