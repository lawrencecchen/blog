reasonably constrained problems that are possible (but difficult) to tackle oneself. or just some yaks yet to be shaved.

- browser extension for searching through history
  - we can [vampire attack twitter](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2022/04/16/vampire-attack-twitter.html)
  - local first, store data in sqlite-indexeddb
  - also index a cached version of the website. not only can you search through history, but you can search through contextual information in your browsing history
- open source replit. what design choices will enable an individual to create a competitive version of replit
  - stuff to keep
    - codemirror
    - react
    - nix (maybe steal railway's nixpacks??)
  - stuff to change
    - yjs/crdts
    - build on fly.io instead for gcp. don't bother with your own infrastructure
- keyboardless keyboard + unix/repl/browser glasses
    - you want a brain interface but you also have to [reconcile the infinite and finite](https://amasad.me/kierkegaard#:~:text=I%20view%20entrepreneurship%20as%20means%20of%20reconciling%20the%20infinite%20and%20finite.) (you suck at tech but you still want cool stuff (even though it sucks)).
    - codespaces, mightyapp
    - web browser is best metaverse
      - screw apple(2007-202?)/meta(2025-2???) tax
- HTML/tailwind collaborative editor. figma for the web
    - compression of workflows (figma → slack → github → github issues)
    - modern CSSedit. start by selling (or giving away) tailwindui-esque components
    - [ESM url imports](https://esm.vercel.app/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20import%20ES%20Modules%20from%20tools%20like%20Framer%3A)
    - constrained case: figma (or png) to html/jsx
    - the beginning of webflow 2.0. no-code interface to the "center-stack" (coined by remix)
- modern reading experience
    - ["read what you love until you love to read"](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002068699761659905?s=20)
    - tiktok algorithm for text/books
        - get to the best part of a book, quick
        - compression of typically dense mediums
        - an internet that doesn't require the mental overhead of browsing
            - (tiktok is essentially its own internet)
            - reading/clicking links (goodreads/reddit/hackernews/web/blogs/youtube) is pure mental overhead
                - twitter/tiktok/newsfeed/instagramfeed has less mental overhead, but significantly less signal to noise
                    - constrained to present. closest thing we can get to dead-peoples’ twitter (that also has alive voices as well).
                        - dead:alive ratio can contextualize zeitgeist with past, current events with history
                - can creativity/innovation be sustained when we delegate choice to an algorithm that rewards popularity ([law of averages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_averages))?
                - would it truly shave mental overhead (compression/faster time to idea) or only dole out cheap dopamine boosts?
                    - at the same time, you could be exposed to a larger diversity of ideas if  randomness is built into the algorithm
    - loss function to satiate curiosity
    - spend compute to unearth gems from the library of babel
    - endless feed of ideas
    - swipe down for new content, swipe right for next page
        - prioritize swiping down
    - honestly books are pretty good let's skip this one
- modern shopping experience
    - one click buy
    - tiktok feed
