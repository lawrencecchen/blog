TL;DR Coderouter is a web app that spawns Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel. It also has a convenient diff/PR-merging interface to make it easy to review code.

Recently, I've almost completely moved from Cursor to Claude Code. I spend more time in the vscode terminal than I do in Cursor's sidebar.

Each one of the "node" terminals is an instance of Claude Code. Usually, I can only juggle two or three Claudes at a time in different parts of the codebase. Most of the "node" processes at the top are Claude sessions from the past, as I find it easier to make new terminals instead of clearing Claude's context.

I've recently started using git worktrees to make more isolated environments for Claude Code.

Instead of juggling claudes in a single directory, I really should be using git worktrees.
