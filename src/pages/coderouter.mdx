TL;DR Coderouter is a web app that spawns Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel. It also has a convenient git diff/PR-review interface to make it easy to review code.

Recently, I've almost completely moved from Cursor to Claude Code. I spend more time in the vscode terminal + vscode git than I do in Cursor's sidebar.

Each one of the "node" terminals is an instance of Claude Code (--dangerously-skip-permissions!). Usually, I can only juggle two or three Claudes at a time in different parts of the codebase. Most of the "node" processes at the top are Claude sessions from the past, as I find it easier to make new terminals instead of clearing Claude's context.

I've recently started using git worktrees to make more isolated environments for Claude Code.

Instead of juggling claudes in a single directory, I really should be using git worktrees.

Coderouter uses git worktrees to make isolated environments for Claude Code. It also uses 

## Sandboxing

On macOS, Codex uses sandbox-exec as a minimal sandbox. Claude Code uses

## Searching for the best CLI coding agent

Today, the best general coding agent is Claude Code. But codex + o3 is anecdotally better for me when I want to implement/optimize a well defined piece of code that doesn't require significant retrieval. Not having to think about which implementation is better for what is one of the goals of coderouter, though this comes at the (sometimes steep) cost of tokens.
