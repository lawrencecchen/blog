TL;DR Coderouter is a web app that spawns Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel. It also has a convenient git diff/PR-review interface to make it easy to review code.

Recently, I've almost completely moved from Cursor to Claude Code. I spend more time in the vscode terminal + vscode git than I do in Cursor's sidebar.

Each one of the "node" terminals is an instance of Claude Code (--dangerously-skip-permissions!). Usually, I can only juggle two or three Claudes at a time in different parts of the codebase. Most of the "node" processes at the top are Claude sessions from the past, as I find it easier to make new terminals instead of clearing Claude's context.

I've recently started using git worktrees to make more isolated environments for Claude Code.

Instead of juggling claudes in a single directory, I really should be using git worktrees.

Coderouter uses git worktrees to make isolated environments for Claude Code. It also uses 

## Sandboxing

On macOS, Codex uses sandbox-exec as a minimal sandbox. Claude Code uses

## Searching for the best CLI coding agent

Today, the best general coding agent is Claude Code. But codex + o3 is anecdotally better for me when I want to implement/optimize a well defined piece of code that doesn't require significant retrieval. Not having to think about which implementation is better for what is one of the goals of coderouter, though this comes at the (sometimes steep) cost of tokens.

## Tools for reviewing work

The first iteration of coderouter included runs + diffs:

I still found myself going back to the vscode terminal though, since there was no easy way to verify if the code worked or not. Having a vscode instance where I could easily look at the logs was important.

## Other Claude Code wrappers

## Standards

There exists AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .cursorrules, etc. If you have a CLAUDE.md file, Coderouter will automatically create the right files for each coding agent.

AGENTS.md

## After Cursor

operator automatically navigates to the right page and takes a screenshot and sends to you in chat.

after cursor is pretty much devin.
after devin is linear, like kanban where you see all the tickets and what needs reviewing.
after linear is tiktok + tinder. like infinite feed of agents with completed tasks that need your review. ideally with evidence that makes things easily verifiable. like computer use trajectories. or veo3/ai generated videos that somehow convey the right information?

what's after tiktok/tinder?
is the developer even relevant then?
